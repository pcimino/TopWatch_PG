Some basic Canvas shapes for Enyo 2.x.

Please note these are wrappers of the HTML5 Canavas elements. There seem to be some quirks implementing some of these. Suggestions/feedback welcomed.

# Line
A basic line. You can try it out on JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/pcimino/VW2QV/

# Arc
A basic Arc. You can try it out on JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/pcimino/2P9AU/

# Vector
Draw a line given the starting point, an angle and a length. You can also specify the distance to start drawing from the point. This is handy for lines emanating form a central point, but not connected to that point.

See the example and try it out at JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/pcimino/VW2QV/

# PolyLine
Draw multiple attached line segments, with the option to close the shape and fill it. You can try it out on JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/pcimino/ssax7/

# PolyCurve
## NOT READY for prime time. 
Having issues with properties not taking. The only way it renders visibly is if the shape is closed and filled.
